# Cyberpunk Ultra+ v2.0 Alpha

## Goals
1. **Improve path tracing for as many people as possible**
  a. Speed up PT as much as possible ("Fast") so more people can play it
  b. Improve PT quality (reducing edge and boiling noise) for high-end PCs and those sensitive to PT noise
  c. Ray tracing + path tracing for AMD and lower-powered PCs
3. **Change modes in real-time** so users can see differences for themselves
4. **Fix PT / RT bugs** that can be fixed via engine manipulation
5. **Improve game stability**

Sorry for my terrible screen capture!

## Contributing

Please feel free to pitch in! I don't know LUA or ImGui and have limited time, so help is wonderful. This is a proof of concept.

## To Do
- Put all feature / distance / etc. tabs onto one page
- Saving of Ultra+'s mode (RTPT, PT20, samples, etc...)
- Enable RTPT option (including changing the engine's ray tracing mode in real-time)
- Enable no-ray/path tracing mode
- Add streaming options (? vanilla, medium, high)
- Remove options that are confusing or don't add any value
- Separate settings into separate file(s)
